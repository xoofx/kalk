`kalk` is supported on the following platforms:

- Windows x64, arm, arm64
- Linux x64, arm64 (Debian derivatives - e.g Ubuntu - and distributions supporting RPM packages)
- macOS x64, arm64 (High Sierra and higher)

{{NOTE do}}
The current stable version: **`{{ kalk_version }}`** ([Release notes]({{site.github_repo_url}}/releases/tag/{{kalk_version}}))

- `kalk` requires a terminal that supports ANSI escape codes. 
- On Windows, `kalk` works best on **Windows 10** which has built-in support for terminal with ANSI escape codes and with the new [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701).
- `kalk` might not work well if your terminal doesn't have the same level of support than the Windows Terminal regarding ANSI escape codes.
